# Mute button/status indicator for Google Meet

This is a fork from the original meet-mute-button from [fedor2](https://github.com/jfedor2/meet-mute-button) that is still under construction.

I'm currently working on adding up-down volume and hangup capabilities while maintaining the form factor.

The idea is to replace the mechanical keyboard switch with a rotary encoder that has a push switch.
