# Mute button/status indicator for Google Meet

This is a fork of the original [meet-mute-button by fedor2](https://github.com/jfedor2/meet-mute-button), currently under active development to add more features while maintaining the original compact form factor.

This version replaces the original mechanical keyboard switch with a rotary encoder that includes an integrated push-button, enabling more functionality.

## Current Features

*   **Volume Control**: Rotate the encoder to adjust the system's default output volume.
*   **Mute/Unmute**: A single press of the encoder switch toggles the mute status.
*   **Push-to-Talk (PTT)**: A long press enables a momentary mute, just like the original.
*   **Hang Up**: A double-press of the switch hangs up the current call.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Adapt the 3D-printed case for the new rotary encoder.
- [ ] Add project photos and a demonstration video.
